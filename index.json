[{"content":"Outline My first contact with machine learning and data science The rise of initial deep learning concepts and hinderance for advancements How something which is very abstract like deep learning could have only being seen as success with non-feature based tasks The visible progress made things more attractive for others to work on similar problems Advancements due to large scale label datasets as well as hardware requirements restriction to implement initially researched AI algorithms. CNNs specially capable of working with spatial information, which start with building simple lines and then build complex features as architectures get deeper compared to tradition algorithms which treat all features as same level an then feature out importance Go through early papers describing the history and state of deep learning as of 2015, Deep learning paper by LeCun, Geoffrey Hilton, Yoshua Bengio One of the important things going for images is that the representations of images in number format has been resolved for a long time as versus text format, if we take a color across any format the RGB will define clearly how to represent it. In case, of text different authors, dialects and langauges can lead to very different meaning.
